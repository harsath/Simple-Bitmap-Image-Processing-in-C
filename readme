This repository contains Simple Bitmap processing written in C

This project is far from complete and I build this just because I was playing around with 
processing Bitmaps in C 

Feel free to clone it and build your own version from my existing C code

How to use it?
First, Compile the source code
$make install

A Binary image-pipe will be generated
$./image-pipe --negative --bright --src test_img/lena512.bmp --dest FOLDERNAME
